        <p>Hi! I'm Kinjal. I am 21 years old living in Ontario, Canada. I am an undergrad student, working an internship
            and trying to find my purpose in life. Follow along my journey as I try to navigate through life and see 
            where life wants to take me. My goal for this website is to build, inspire, provide, grow, and learn. I want 
            to build a website to the best potential and build a community doing it. I want to inspire others and provide 
            motivation to others through quotes, books, and blogs. I want to grow this website and spread motivation. Lastly,
            I want to learn from constructive criticism.

        <h2>Why I started Motivational Matters</h2>
        <p>The reason I started motivational matters is in hopes for other people like me, who just need some motivation in life.
            To find their purpose to start working towards that goal they've been reaching for, but just can't reach or to just find their purpose, the meaning
            behind their time here, the reason we keep on living.
            Hopefully this is the starting point to someones motivational journey.
            Sometimes we all feel lost, I know I do. The journey through purpose and life is a long and interesting one. 
            Follow along with me as I walk through this journey with you. <b>One Step at a Time. One Breath at a Time.</b>

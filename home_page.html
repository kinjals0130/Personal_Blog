        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
        <p>Whether we define motivation as a drive or need, it is a condition inside us that desires a change.
            When we are motivated, we move and take action. </p>

        <h3>Types of Motivation</h3>
        <!-- Open The Modal -->
        <button id="myBtn1" class = "modalBtn">Extrinsic Motivations</button>
        <button id="myBtn2" class = "modalBtn">Intrinsic Motivations</button>
        <!-- Modal 1 -->
        <div id="myModal1" class="modal">

                <span class="close">&times;</span>
                <p>Motivation that often involves rewards or incentives and comes from external sources, such as: praise, fame, money, etc.</p>
                <p>An example of Extrinsic Motivation: Being paid to do a job that you may not find particularly interesting or exciting.</p>
                <p>Although it is a very effective form of motivation, it can still have negative effects. When overused, activities that were initially fun can be transformed into obligations when tied to an external reward.</p>

                <p>Motivation that comes from within a person, driven by internal rewards, such as: satisfaction and gratification.</p>
                <p>"Intrinsic motivation occurs when we act without any obvious external rewards. We simply enjoy an activity or see it as an opportunity to explore, learn, and actualize our potentials."</p>
                <p>An example of Intrinsic Motivation: Painting a picture or taking a walk because you like to or it makes you happy.</p>
                <p>Although it can drive behaviour in all aspects of life, the way in which the individual views the importance of different characteristics of the event impacts whether the reward will affect the Intrinsic motivation for participating in that activity.</p>
